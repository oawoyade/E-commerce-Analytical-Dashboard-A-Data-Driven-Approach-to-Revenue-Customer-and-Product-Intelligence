## 📘 **About This Project**

The **E-commerce Analytical Dashboard** was created to address a common challenge in the e-commerce space: fragmented transactional data scattered across multiple tables and systems. Using **SQL**, **Power BI**, and a robust **star-schema data model**, this project transforms raw sales, customer, and product data into actionable business intelligence.

The dashboard aggregates more than **$1M** in sales, **$250K** in profit, and **58K** units sold, providing a 360° view of business performance. Interactive visuals and advanced DAX calculations enable deeper insights into sales trends, customer behaviour, product profitability, and market performance. The solution empowers business leaders to track revenue drivers, evaluate segment performance, and make informed operational and strategic decisions.

## 🧩 **Data Model (Star Schema)**

The analytical foundation is built on a clean star schema:

- **FactSales** — Sales records including revenue, profit, discount, quantity, and date  
- **DimCustomer** — Customer attributes and segments  
- **DimProduct** — Product details including category and subcategory  
- **DimLocation** — Country, region, market and city attributes  
- **DimDate** — Calendar table for time intelligence  
- **Measure Table** — All DAX calculations  

This structure enables fast querying, efficient filtering, and scalable reporting.
